# ZCU104 OVERVIEW
The AMD Xilinx ZCU104 evaluation board is built around the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZU7EV device, which combines a powerful processing system with flexible FPGA fabric on a single chip. The processing system includes a quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 for applications, dual ARM Cortex-R5F cores for real-time tasks, and a Mali-400 GPU for graphics. The ZU7EV device also has a built-in hardware video codec capable of H.264 and H.265 encoding and decoding, making the board suitable for embedded vision and multimedia workloads.

The ZCU104 provides a wide range of interfaces such as Gigabit Ethernet, USB 3.0, DisplayPort, HDMI, MIPI CSI, UART, I2C, SPI, CAN, and PMOD connectivity. It includes an FMC LPC connector that exposes 34 differential pairs for high-speed expansion modules and custom hardware interfaces. The board is equipped with 4 GB DDR4 memory for the processing system, an additional DDR4 for the programmable logic, QSPI flash, and a microSD card slot for booting.

One of the main strengths of the ZCU104 is the tight integration of software and hardware. The ARM processors run operating systems or bare-metal applications, while the programmable logic implements custom accelerators, DSP pipelines, hardware offloading engines, or real-time control logic. Communication between the PS and PL happens through AXI interfaces, allowing high-bandwidth data movement. Development is typically done using Vivado for hardware design and Vitis or SDK for software, with PetaLinux available for building custom Linux images.

The board is commonly used for applications like computer vision, AI acceleration, robotics, SDR and communication systems, automotive ADAS prototyping, and high-performance signal processing. My work with the ZCU104 includes learning the PS-PL flow, writing custom Verilog modules, experimenting with on-board interfaces, exploring clocking and constraints, developing communication between devices, and understanding how software running on the ARM cores can control or interact with programmable logic.
